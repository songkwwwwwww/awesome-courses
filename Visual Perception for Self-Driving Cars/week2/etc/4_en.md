So, far this week we've learned how to detect features, compute their descriptors, and perform brute force matching using distance functions. We're almost ready to start applying feature detection, description, and matching to self-driving car perception. In this video, we will explore the issue of ambiguous matches and how to make our matches more robust to matching errors caused by similar feature descriptors through the distance ratio formulation. But first, let's review the two feature matching cases we discussed in the last lesson. In the first case, we have a useful feature descriptor that clearly gives a small distance to the feature f2 and a large distance to other features in the second image. In this case we can successfully identify the correct match to the feature f1 and image one. Our brute force matching algorithm works well with this descriptor and as seamlessly capable of finding the right match in image two. In the second case, the feature f1 in image one does not have a match at all in image two. We modified our brute force matching algorithm with a threshold delta to eliminate incorrect matches in this case. Since both features and image two have a distance greater than the distance threshold Delta, the brute force matcher rejects both the features f2 and f3 as potential matches and no match is returned. But, let us consider a third case, once again we are trying to match feature f1 in image one to a corresponding feature in image two. With the feature vectors presented here, feature f1 gets an SSD value of nine with feature two in image two. We test another feature f3, and we also get an SSD of nine. Both of these features have an SSD less than Delta which was 20 in this case, and as such are valid matches.  So what should we do? We refer to feature fi in case three as a feature with ambiguous matches. An elegant solution to this problem was proposed by David Lowe in 1999. The solution goes as follows. First, we compute the distance between feature fi in image one and all the features fj in image two, similar to our previous algorithm, we choose the feature fc in image two with the minimum distance to feature fi in image of one as our closest match. We then proceed to get feature fs the feature in image two with the second closest distance to the feature fi. Finally, we find how much nearer our closest match fc is over our second closest match fs. This can be done through the distance ratio. The distance ratio can be defined as the distance computed between feature fi in image one and fc the closest match in image two. Over the distance computed between feature fi and fs, the second closest match in image two. If the distance ratio is close to one, it means that according to our descriptor and distance function, fi matches both fs and fc. In this case, we don't want to use this match in our processing later on, as it clearly is not known to our matcher which location in image two corresponds to the feature in image one. Let us update our brute force matcher algorithm with the distance ratio formulation. The updates replace the distance with the ratio of distance as our metric to keep matches. We usually set the distance ratio threshold which we'll refer to as row somewhere around 0.5, which means that we require our best match to be at least twice as close as our second best match to our initial features descriptor. Revisiting case three, we can see that using the distance ratio and a corresponding threshold row set to 0.5, we discard our ambiguous matches and retain the good ones. In this video, you've learned what ambiguous matches are, and how to handle these ambiguous matches through the distance ratio formulation. Unfortunately, even with the distance ratio formulation, as much as 50 percent of typical matches can still be wrong when using modern descriptors. This is because, repetitive patterns in images and small variations in pixel values, are often sufficient to confuse the matching process. We call these erroneous matches outliers. For our next lesson, I will describe a method to account for and eliminate outliers before using are matched features for further perception tasks.
