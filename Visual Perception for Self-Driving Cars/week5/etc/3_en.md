Welcome to the final lesson for this week. In the previous lesson, we learned how to perform semantic segmentation using convolutional neural networks. In this video, we will learn how to use the output of these networks for scene understanding of road scenes. Specifically, you will learn how to use the output of semantic segmentation models to estimate the drivable space and lane boundaries. Let's quickly review what we expect as an output from a semantic segmentation model. A semantic segmentation model takes an image as an input, and provides us output, a category classification for every pixel. Now let's use this output to perform some useful tasks for self-driving cars. The first task we will be discussing is the estimation of a drivable surface from semantic segmentation output in 3D. Drivable space is defined as the region in front of the vehicle where it is safe to drive. In the context of semantic segmentation, the drivable surface includes all pixels from the road, crosswalks, lane markings, parking spots, and even sometimes rail tracks. Estimating a drivable surface is very important as it is one of the main steps for constructing occupancy grids from 3D depth sensors. You will learn more about occupancy grids in course 4, where they will be used to represent where obstacles are located in the environment during collision avoidance. But for now, let's describe how to perform drivable surface estimation from the semantic segmentation output. First, we use a ConvNet to generate the semantic segmentation output of an image frame, we then generate 3D coordinates of some of the pixels in this frame, either from stereo data or by projecting a lighter point cloud to the image plane. With a known extrinsic calibration between sensors, we can project lidar points into the image plane and match them to the corresponding pixels. We then proceed to choose 3D points that belong to the drivable surface category. As we mentioned earlier, this category should at least include the road, lane markings, and pedestrian crossings. In certain scenarios, other classes such as railroad tracks for example might also be included, depending on the driving context. All other classes are excluded even if their height is similar to the drivable surface. Finally, we use this subset of 3D points to estimate a drivable surface model. The complexity of this model can range from a simple plane to more complex spline surface models. Let's describe how to robustly fits a planar drivable surface model given segmented image data and lidar points. We first define the model of a plane as ax plus by plus z equals d, where x, y, z is any point on the plane, the coefficients a, b, and 1 define the plane normal vector, and d is a constant offset. We can form a set of linear equations to estimate the parameters of this plane model using as measurements, each of the points identified as belonging to the drivable surface. The parameters of the model are now summarized by the vector p, and the measurements are separated into the matrices A and B. As formulated in course 2, we can find a solution for this system of linear equations using the method of least squares. As a result, our plane parameter vector p is equal to the pseudoinverse of A times B. This model has three free parameters to be estimated, and as such, we need at least three non-colinear 3D points to fit the plane. In practice, we will have many more points than are necessary, so we can apply the method of least squares once again to identify parameters that minimize the mean square distance of all points from the plane. Of course, some points will be labeled incorrectly and may not truly belong to the drivable surface. So how can we avoid incorrect semantic labels negatively affecting the quality of a drivable surface plane estimation? Fortunately for us, we learned a very powerful and robust estimation method in week 2 of this course. Specifically, we can use the RANSAC algorithm to robustly fit a drivable surface plane model even with some errors in our semantic segmentation output. Let's go through the RANSAC algorithm for the drivable surface estimation as a refresher. First, we randomly select the minimum number of data points required to fit our model. In this case, we randomly choose three points in 3D. Second, we use these three points to compute the model parameters a, b, and d, and use the method of least squares to solve for our plane parameters. We then proceed to determine the number of 3D points that satisfy these model parameters. Usually for drivable surface estimation, most of the outliers are a result of the erroneous segmentation outputs located at the boundaries. If the number of outliers is low, we terminate and return the computed plane parameters. Otherwise, we sample three new points at random and repeat the process. Then once the algorithm meets its termination condition, we calculate the final planar surface model of the road from all of the inliers in the largest inlier set. The use of a planar surface model works well if the road is actually flat, a valid assumption in many driving scenarios. For more complex scenarios, such as entering a steeply climbing highway entrance from a flat roadway for example, more complex models are needed. Although we estimate the drivable surface, we still have not determined where the car is allowed to drive on this surface. Usually, a vehicle should stay within its lane, determined by lane markings or the road boundaries. Lane estimation is the task of estimating where a self-driving car can drive given a drivable surface. Many methods exist in the literature to accomplish this task. For example, some methods directly estimate lane markings from ConvNets to determine where the car can drive. However, for higher-level decision-making, a self-driving car should also be aware of what is at the boundary of the lane. Classes at the boundary of the lame can range from a curb, a road, where opposite traffic resides or dynamic in parked vehicles. The self-driving car has to base its maneuvers on what objects occur at the boundary of the lane, especially during emergency pull overs. We will refer to the task of estimating the lane and what occurs at its boundaries as semantic lane estimation. Notice that if we estimate the lane using the output of semantic segmentation, we get boundary classification for free. Let's go through a simple approach to this problem to clarify the lane estimation task. Given the output of a semantic segmentation model, we first extract a binary mask of the pixels belonging to classes that occur as lane separators. Such classes can include curbs, lane markings, or rails for example. Then we apply an edge detector to the binary mask. As you remember from the first week of this course, edge detectors can be as simple as estimating gradients from convolutions. Here, we use a famous edge detector, the canny edge detector. The output are pixels classified as edges that will be used to estimate the lane boundaries. The final step is to determine which model is to be used to estimate the lanes. The choice of models defines what the next step will be. Here we choose a linear lane model, where each lane is assumed to be made up of a single line. To detect lines in the output edge map, we need aligned detector. The Hough transform line detection algorithm is widely used and capable of detecting multiple lines in an edge map. Given an edge map, the Hough transform can generate a set of lines that link pixels belonging to edges in the edge map. The minimum length of the required lines can be set as a hyperparameter to force the algorithm to only detect lines that are long enough to be part of lane markings. Further refinement can be applied based on the scenario at hand. For example, we know that our lane should not be a horizontal line if our camera is placed forward facing in the direction of motion. Furthermore, we can remove any line that does not belong to the drivable surface to get a final set of lane boundary primitives. The last step would be to determine the classes that occur at both sides of the lane, which can easily be done by considering the classes on both sides of the estimated lane lines. We will not discuss edge detectors and Hough transforms in detail, as these topics deserve a separate discussion outside the scope of this course. However, powerful computer vision libraries such as Open CV, have open-source implementations, and tutorials on how to detect lines using the Hough transform, and how to detect edges using the Canny edge detector. If interested, take a look at how these algorithms are used in practice using the links provided in the supplementary material. In summary, semantic segmentation can be used to estimate the drivable space, to determine what occurs at the boundary of the drivable space, and to estimate lanes on the drivable surface. The applications discussed so far are very active areas of research, and what you've learned during this lesson provides a solid starting point and competitive baselines for the task of semantic lane detection and drivable surface estimation. Furthermore, semantic lane detection and drivable surface estimation are the most prominent uses for semantic segmentation models in the context of self-driving cars. However, semantic segmentation has many more useful applications. Most importantly, aiding the self-driving car in performing both 2D object detection and localization. With information about which pixels to evaluate for objects or weather features are on static or moving objects, the robustness of the perception system can be significantly improved. It can act as a sanity check or a filter to avoid including incorrect information in other perception tasks. Semantic segmentation is a powerful tool for self-driving cars and a core component of the high level perception stack. You will have the chance to validate its usefulness next week when we discuss our final assignment.  See you then.
